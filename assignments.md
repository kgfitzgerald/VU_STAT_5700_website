## Homework

The links below provide the assigned problems for each homework. You may type or hand-write your work, but you should submit a single pdf to the corresponding assignment on Blackboard.

## Labs

Clicking on a link below will download a template Quarto document (.qmd) for each Lab. Instructions are provided in the Quarto document. Once downloaded, you should place the .qmd in the STAT_5700 folder you created on your computer. Complete the lab by typing your code & answers in the .qmd. You will turn in a rendered .html file to Blackboard.
